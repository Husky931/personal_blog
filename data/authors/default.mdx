My name is Pecev Gligor and i am a fullstack developer with several years of experience. I graduated computer science university with 3D modeling, animation and rendering as post graduate.

I have been fortunate to have lived and worked on 3 continents, with the last 3-4 years spent in Shanghai and being involved and working in the tech startup scene there.

Besides coding the fullstack aspect of an application, i have always found the marketing and launching aspect just as interesting. This is why i have often made solo projects where i would wear all hats and focus on getting traction and users for my project, besides coding it.

Lately i have been experimenting with the creating video content (manual edits and AI) and use it as part of my workflow.
